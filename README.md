# Libipt

> The Intel Processor Trace (Intel PT) Decoder Library is Intel's reference
implementation for decoding Intel PT.  It can be used as a standalone library or
it can be partially or fully integrated into your tool.

This Repository contains high level rust bindings for the complete functionality provided by [the original libipt library](https://github.com/intel/libipt).

Huge thanks to the rust discord community for being awesome and helping me out with some stuffs :D.

## Testing

All of the functionality is implemented and should be working
but the test coverage is not complete.
If there is interest in this library i might add some more testing.
Contributions are also appreciated.

## Documentation

I did my best to provide useful documentation for most of the library.
If you see any missing or weird documentation feel free to open an issue or pull request.
